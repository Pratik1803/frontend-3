                    <ul><li><p>After creating your account on the Platform, you must nominate a person (“nominee”) to receive the balance in your Wallet in the event of your death. Your nominee must be above the age of legal majority in their country of residence. In case your nominee dies before you, you must choose a new nominee within 30 (thirty) days. Your nominee will have the responsibility of notifying Social Comment about your death via email to <a href="mailto:thesocialcomments@gmail.com">thesocialcomments@gmail.com</a>. This notification should be made within thirty (30) days of your death and must be accompanied by your death certificate or any other relevant proof of death, your nominee’s proof of identity, and your nominee’s bank account details.</p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>If your nominee notifies Social Comment about your death within thirty (30) days of your death, Social Comment shall transfer the total amount due to your nominee’s bank account within forty-five (45) days. However, if your nominee notifies Social Comment about your death after the expiry of thirty (30) days, it may take Social Comment up to six (6) months from the date of notification to transfer the total amount due to your nominee’s bank account. If your nominee dies after notifying Social Comment under clause 5.1, Social Comment will nonetheless transfer the total amount due to your nominee’s bank account only. </p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>The total amount due shall be the balance in your Wallet on the day Social Comment receives the notification of your death from your nominee, or the notification of your and your nominee’s death from your legal heir, as the case may be. Please note that your Wallet will not reflect, and your nominee will not be entitled to, any payments due to you under this Policy resulting from the use of your referral code/link by new users after the day on which Social Comment receives the notification your nominee/your legal heir. However, Social Comment may, at its discretion, include all or a portion of such payments in the total amount due. The total amount due shall not include, and your nominee or legal heir shall not be entitled to, any interest or mesne profits on the balance in your Wallet. </p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>If your nominee dies before notifying Social Comment about your death under clause 6.1, your legal heir can claim the total amount due by notifying Social Comment about your death and the death of your nominee via email to <a href="mailto:thesocialcomments@gmail.com">thesocialcomment@gmail.com</a>.  This notification must be accompanied by your death certificate or any other relevant proof of death, your nominee’s death certificate or any other relevant proof of death, your legal heir’s proof of identity, a valid Succession Certificate, and your legal heir’s bank account details. </p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>If your legal heir notifies Social Comment about your and your nominee’s death within thirty (30) days of your nominee’s death, Social Comment shall transfer the total amount due to your legal heir’s bank account within forty-five (45) days of receiving the signed undertaking. However, if your legal heir notifies Social Comment after the expiry of thirty (30) days, it may take Social Comment up to six (6) months from the date of receiving the undertaking to transfer the total amount due to your legal heir’s bank account. In case your nominee dies before you and you also die before you can change your nominee, the period of thirty (30) days in this sub-clause shall be counted from the date of your death.</p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>You hereby agree and acknowledge that no person or entity claiming under or through you (including, without limitation, the nominee of the bank account linked with your Wallet on the Platform and any of your legal heirs or successors) will have any legal claim against Social Comment, or any claim on the total amount due, once the total amount due has been paid by Social Comment either to nominee or legal heir in accordance with this clause.</p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>Upon transferring the total amount due to your nominee or legal heir, Social Comment shall inform them of the same and close your account in accordance with our Terms of Service within two (2) days of the completion of the transfer. Additionally, if you do not log into your account for a period of seven (7) years and Social Comment does not receive any notification from your nominee or your legal heir during the same period, or if your nominee or legal heir fails to furnish any required documents or complete any procedures required under this clause within seven (7) years, Social Comment shall forfeit any balance in your Wallet and close your account in accordance with our Terms of Service. Once the balance in your Wallet has been forfeited and your account has been closed, neither you nor your nominee, legal heir, or any other person or entity shall have any claim to the balance so forfeited and Social Comment shall have no obligation to pay the balance forfeited to any person or entity.  </p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>Your nominee or legal heir shall have the sole responsibility for paying all applicable taxes cess, liabilities or charges payable to the Government or any other authority or body (including, without limitation income tax) on the total amount due which is transferred to their bank account by Social Comment. Under no circumstances (including, without limitation, where your nominee or legal heir only pays a part of the applicable tax) shall Social Comment be required to pay any tax on the behalf of your nominee or legal heir with respect to the total amount due (or part thereof) which is transferred to their bank account by Social Comment.</p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>In case your nominee or legal heir disagrees with our determination of the total amount due, they can send Social Comment an email at <a href="mailto:thesocialcomment@gmail.com">thesocialcomment@gmail.com</a> listing their objection with appropriate proof at the earliest. Social Comment shall review their objections and take all appropriate steps within a reasonable amount of time. </p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>For the purposes of clause 6.2, your nominee shall be said to have notified Social Comment only if they include all the required documents and/or attachments mentioned in clause 6.1 with their notification. For the purposes of clause 6.5, your legal heir shall be said to have notified Social Comment only if they include all the required documents and/or attachments mentioned in clause 6.4 with their notification. </p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>If your nominee or legal heir is unable to obtain any of the documents and/or attachments required under clauses 6.1 or 6.4, they can contact Social Comment at <a href="mailto:thesocialcomments@gmail.com">thesocialcomments@gmail.com</a> with the reasons for their inability to obtain the required documents and/or attachments. Social Comment shall review these reasons and may, at its discretion and on a case-to-case basis, provide an alternative mechanism for your nominee or legal heir to receive the total amount due. </p></li></ul>
