                    <h5>Feedback Mechanism. </h5>
                    <br />

                        Also, we encourage our employers to send interview/internship/job feedback to candidates. They should first though check with their policies to make sure they won’t invite legal action. Being brief, respectful and keeping feedback job-related are the general gesture for writing/giving feedback emails/ratings to candidates.

                    <h5>Revoked offers. </h5>
