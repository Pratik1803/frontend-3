                    <h5>Employee selection stages: </h5>
                    <br />
                    <p>Employer can choose some standard hiring process that may be tweaked according to a roleâ€™s requirements. The standard process involves:</p>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>Portfolio/Resume screening.</p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>Phone screening</p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>Test screening.</p></li></ul>
                    <br />

                    <ul><li><p>Offer Letter.</p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <p>Employer may choose to add/remove stages depending on the role theyâ€™re hiring for. For example, they can add the following selection stages/methods:</p>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>Assessment centers.</p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>Group interviews.</p></li></ul>

                    <br />
                    <h5>After selection company can keep an Induction or Orientation</h5>
                    <br />
                    <p>Induction/ Orientation is the final stage of the recruitment process. Once the successful candidate has accepted the offer of employment and a start date has been agreed the company may if thinks fit prepare a comprehensive induction program for the new interns/employee.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h5>Feedback Mechanism. </h5>
                    <br />
                    <p>Recruiters/ hiring managers may inform candidates they interviewed that they decided to reject them. Leaving candidates in the dark can be damaging employer brand/company.
                        Also, we encourage our employers to send interview/internship/job feedback to candidates. They should first though check with their policies to make sure they wonâ€™t invite legal action. Being brief, respectful and keeping feedback job-related are the general gesture for writing/giving feedback emails/ratings to candidates.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h5>Revoked offers. </h5>
                    <br />
                    <p>In case when an offer has to be revoked, the hiring manager/Employer and human resources department of the concerned company should draft and sign an official document. This document should include a legitimate reason for revoking the offer. Legitimate reasons including all the obligation/reason specified in the offer letter provided by the company/ Employer.</p>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>Candidate is proved to not be legally allowed to work for our company at a specific location.</p></li></ul>
                    <br />
                    <ul><li><p>Candidate has falsified references or otherwise lied about a serious issue.</p></li></ul>
                    <br />
